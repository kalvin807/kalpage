# Kalvin's Page 2

Hey, welcome to the source code of my personal page. This time I focus on some all animation and
smooth transition, which made me dig up a bit CSS which is quite interesting after all. Hope you
will like this minimalist's design!

## What I used

- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS

> I also deployed it with cloudflare, so I can have more data abt visitor (if any)

## What to add

- Project list
- Blog when I have the motivation :p
